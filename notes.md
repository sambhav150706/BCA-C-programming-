📘 Day–01 Notes
Computing Fundamentals & History of Computers
1️⃣ What is Computing?

Computing is the process of using a computer to accept data (input), process it, store it, and produce meaningful information (output).

📌 Basic Computing Cycle
Input → Processing → Output → Storage

Example:

Input: Marks of students

Processing: Total, percentage

Output: Result

2️⃣ What is a Computer?

A computer is an electronic device that:

Accepts input data

Processes it using instructions (programs)

Produces output

Stores data for future use

3️⃣ History of Computers
🔹 Early Calculating Devices

Abacus – First calculating tool

Pascaline – Mechanical calculator (Blaise Pascal)

Analytical Engine – Designed by Charles Babbage

📌 Charles Babbage is known as the “Father of Computer”

4️⃣ Generations of Computers
🟢 First Generation (1940–1956)

Technology: Vacuum Tubes

Very large size

High heat consumption

Example: ENIAC

🔵 Second Generation (1956–1963)

Technology: Transistors

Smaller and faster than first generation

🟡 Third Generation (1964–1971)

Technology: Integrated Circuits (ICs)

More reliable and efficient

🔴 Fourth Generation (1971–Present)

Technology: Microprocessors

Personal computers, laptops

🟣 Fifth Generation (Present & Future)

Technology: Artificial Intelligence

AI, Machine Learning, Robotics

📌 Exam Tip: Generations of computers is a very important long-answer topic.

5️⃣ Block Diagram of Computer
Main Components:

Input Unit – Takes data from user

Central Processing Unit (CPU)

ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)

Control Unit (CU)

Memory Unit

Output Unit – Displays result

📌 In exams, always draw a neat diagram for full marks.

6️⃣ Input and Output Devices
🖥️ Input Devices

Keyboard

Mouse

Scanner

Microphone

🖨️ Output Devices

Monitor

Printer

Speaker

Projector

7️⃣ Memory & Storage
🔹 Primary Memory

RAM (Random Access Memory)

Volatile (data lost when power off)

ROM (Read Only Memory)

Non-volatile (permanent data)

Cache Memory

Fastest memory

🔹 Secondary Memory

Hard Disk

SSD

Pen Drive

CD/DVD

8️⃣ Difference Between RAM and ROM
RAM	ROM
Volatile	Non-volatile
Temporary memory	Permanent memory
Faster	Slower
Stores running programs	Stores firmware
9️⃣ Key Exam Points (Must Remember)

Father of Computer → Charles Babbage

CPU parts → ALU + CU

Cache memory → Fastest

RAM → Volatile

ROM → Non-volatile
